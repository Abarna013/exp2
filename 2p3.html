        <h3>TECH SOC</h3>
        <p><i>TechSoc was first born in 2005 as a tournament where hostels could compete against each other in all tech-related events for points, power and glory. TechSoc has since grown steadily, adding events to its repertoire every year. Together with Schroeter and Lit Soc, it forms the three independent “Big” trophies that hostels battle for every year. TechSoc is being re-envisioned as a forum with a much wider reach than inter-hostel events. It has now become the umbrella under which all tech-related student initiatives will be encouraged and nurtured.</i></p>

        <p><i>In the odd semester, various informal sessions like the tech-interaction “Fundae” sessions will also be organised so freshmen can learn about the technical world they are about to step into. </i></p>
